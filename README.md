# About Text-book-companion
**Textbook companion project (TBC)** is organized by FOSSEE, IIT Bombay (https://fossee.in/). TBC aims to provide computer-based solutions to problems present in textbooks. Interested students should choose a textbook and a free/open ware software. Then, they must provide solutions for all numerically solvable examples of the textbook using the software chosen (for more details: https://scilab.in/Textbook_Companion_Project). TBC is usually a three months online internship, after which the FOSSEE team will review the submitted scripts and publish the code on the offical FOSSEE website.

The work done by me is also available at https://scilab.in/textbook_run/3942/4/1.

# My TBC
I have chosen the "Fluid Mechanics: Applications and Fundamentals by Y. A. Cengel and J. M. Cimbala" textbook and "SCILAB" to code the problems. “SCILAB” is a free and open-source software for engineers & scientists (https://www.scilab.org/). So, out of 161 solved examples in the book, I have coded 109 solved numerical examples. The remaining examples were either theory questions or questions with no numerical computation. In each example, I have uploaded source code, result plots (if available), dependency files (if available). A dependency file contains all the additional information like standard data table, charts, figures, etc., necessary to solve numerical problems.
