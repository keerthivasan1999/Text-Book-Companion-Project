# About Text-book-companion
Text book companion project (TBC) is organized by FOSSEE (https://fossee.in/) of Indian Institue of Technology-Bombay. TBC aims to provide computer based solution to problems present in textbooks. Interested student should choose a book in the interested engineering decipline and also a free/openware software. After choosing all these, he/she is required to provide solution for all numerical solved example in the software choosed.(reference: https://scilab.in/Textbook_Companion_Project) This is usually a three months internship after which submitted code will be reviewd by the FOSSEE team.

# My TBC
I have choosen "Fluid Mechanics:Applications and Fundamentals by Y.A.Cengel and J.M.Cimbala" textbook and "SCILAB" to code the problems. So, out of 161 solved examples in the book I coded 108 solved numerical examples. Remaining examples were theory questions or questions with numerical computation. I have also uploaded result graphs (if available) file along with source code in each chapters. Some code require depandency file. Depandency file is standard data table or graphs or figures, etc which is required to solve some numerical problems. Scilab is a free and open source software for engineers & scientists(https://www.scilab.org/).

Following were the link to download the "Fluid Mechanics:Applications and Fundamentals by Y.A.Cengel and J.M.Cimbala" textbook:
