D=30            //D is the diameter of the wind tunnel in 'cm'
X=30            //X is the length of the wind tunnel in 'cm'
V=4.0           //V is the wind tunnel speed in 'm/s'


//Unit conversion
D=D/100         //Conversion from 'cm' to 'm'
X=X/100         //Conversion from 'cm' to 'm'


//Assumption
Nu=1.507E-5     //Nu is the kinematic vicosity of the air in 'm2/s'

//Calculation
//Part (a)
