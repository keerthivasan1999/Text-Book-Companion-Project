//Given data
F_D_m=21.2           //F_D_m is drag force on the model in 'lbf'
V_p=50               //V_p is prototype wind tunnel speed in 'mi/h'

//Assumption
L_p=1                //L_p is length of the prototype in 'm'
//Properties of air at T_p 째C
rho_p=1.184          //rho_p is prototype air density in 'kg/m3'

//Properties of air at T_m 째C

Mu_m=1.754E-5        //Mu_m is model air viscosity in 'kg/(m s)'


//Calculation
L_m=L_p/5            //L_m is length of the model in 'm'
F_D_p=F_D_m*(rho_p/rho_m)*(V_p/V_m)^2*(L_p/L_m)^2//F_D_p is drag force on the prototype in 'lbf'
